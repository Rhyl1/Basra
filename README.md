# The Basra Coffeeshop page


Basra is a lively coffeeshop, located centrally in the city of The Hague, The Netherlands.
For 30 years, it has provided quality cannabis products for its customers.
The business currently has an outdated website, so it needs a new one.

Because of the legal restrictions regarding the promotion of cannabis products, the primary goal of the website will be providing the customer location and opening data at a first glance.

## UX
- Balsamiq was used for the initial wireframe setup.
Link to wireframes:
https://balsamiq.cloud/s6hidiy/pwawtic/r2278?f=N4IgUiBcCMA0IDkoAZ4GEXwDJTiAQrvALJEgBaZA0lANoC6AvkA%3D

There has been an attempt to execute the exact wireframe layout plans,
but the result differs for practical reasons.
Instead, the information for the mobile view was "absorbed" in the grid to be responsively displayed in rows and columns.

The following color scheme was used throughout the site:

The following font-families were used throughout the website: 'Montserrat', sans-serif; & 'Big Shoulders Text', cursive;

### users
The users of the website include consumers, looking for a local coffeeshop. It is expected that these consumer will find
the webpage after initially "Googeling" for results. On request of the owner en because of legal restrictions
the information provided will be general: this is also what the consumer expects.

## Features
### Existing Features

- Route button - allows users to plot a route via Google maps.
- Social links in footer - provide additional contact details if needed.
- Home page
These pages display general info about location, opening times and contact info. On larger screens,
it also displays a jumbotron with a message, emphasising a record of 30 years existence.

- Huisregels page
This section is ended to sum up the houseruls, as they apply for visitors of the coffeeshop.

### Features Left to Implement
- A feature idea is a (Voorlichting / Information) section. This section will show information
about how to resonsibly use the products sold at the coffeeshop.

- Another fiture idea: I would also like to add a (vacature/vacancy) section, where people can apply for jobs or the owner
can post a vacancy when needed.
