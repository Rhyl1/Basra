# Basra Coffeeshop Customer page

Basra is a lively coffeeshop, located centrally in the city of The Hague, The Netherlands.
For 30 years, it has provided quality products for its customers.
The business has a current website, but needs a new one,
since reopening after an extensive make-over.

I have used this project to provide this service:
a relevant make-over of their current, out-dated,(in technique as well as styling) website.
The primary goal will be providing the customer location and opening data at a first glance
and promote a sensible use of their products, within the allowed legal scope.

## UX
Balsamiq was used for the initial wireframe setup.

The plans are executed, but differ in the small layout because of practical issues. While designing the initial idea,
to have stacked sliders for the content was not responsive enough. Instead, the information was absorbed in the grid to be
responsively displayed in one row.

The following colorscheme was used throughout the site:

## Features

- Home
These pages display general info about location, opening times and contact info. On larger screens,
it also displays a jumbotron with a message, emphasising a record of 30 years existence.

- Huisregels
This section is ended to sum up the houseruls, as they apply for visitors of the coffeeshop.

### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea is a (Voorlichting / Information) section. This section will show information
about how to resonsibly use the products sold at the coffeeshop.

I would also like to add a (vacature/vacancy) section, where people can apply for jobs or the owner
can post a vacancy when needed.

## Technologies Used

This project uses:
links to Bootstrap CDN - for the grid
FontAwesome - for icons
Google Fonts - for custom fonts
Links to Hover.css CDN - foor cool hover effects and transitions
Links and iframe to Google maps for location details.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
