# The Basra Coffeeshop page

Basra is a lively coffeeshop, located centrally in the city of The Hague, The Netherlands.
For 30 years, it has provided quality products for its customers.
The business has a current website, but needs a new one,
since reopening after an extensive make-over.

I have used this project to provide this service:
a relevant make-over of their current, out-dated,(in technique as well as styling) website.
The primary goal will be providing the customer location and opening data at a first glance
and promote a sensible use of their products, within the allowed legal scope.

## UX
Balsamiq was used for the initial wireframe setup.

The plans are executed, but differ in the mobile layout because of practical issues. While designing the initial idea,the result turned out not to be responsive enough.
Instead, the information was "absorbed" in the grid to be responsively displayed in one row.

The following colorscheme was used throughout the site:

### users
The users of the website include consumers, looking for a local coffeeshop. It is expected that these consumer will find
the webpage after initially "Googeling" for results. On request of the owner en because of legal restrictions
the information provided will be general: this is also what the consumer expects.

## Features
### Existing Features

- Route button - allows users to plot a route via Google maps.
- Social links in footer - provide additional contact details if needed.
- Home page
These pages display general info about location, opening times and contact info. On larger screens,
it also displays a jumbotron with a message, emphasising a record of 30 years existence.

- Huisregels page
This section is ended to sum up the houseruls, as they apply for visitors of the coffeeshop.

### Features Left to Implement
- A feature idea is a (Voorlichting / Information) section. This section will show information
about how to resonsibly use the products sold at the coffeeshop.

- Another fiture idea: I would also like to add a (vacature/vacancy) section, where people can apply for jobs or the owner
can post a vacancy when needed.
