# The Basra Coffeeshop page


Basra is a lively coffeeshop, located centrally in the city of The Hague, The Netherlands.
For 30 years, it has provided quality cannabis products for its customers.
The business currently has an outdated website, so it needs a new one.

Because of the legal restrictions regarding the promotion of cannabis products, the primary goal of the website will be providing the customer location and opening data at a first glance.

## UX
- Balsamiq was used for the initial wireframe setup.
Link to wireframes:
https://balsamiq.cloud/s6hidiy/pwawtic/r2278?f=N4IgUiBcCMA0IDkoAZ4GEXwDJTiAQrvALJEgBaZA0lANoC6AvkA%3D

There has been an attempt to execute the exact wireframe layout plans,
but the result differs for practical reasons.
Instead, the information for the mobile view was "absorbed" in the grid to be responsively displayed in rows and columns.

### Users
The users of the website include (international) consumers, looking for a local coffee shop. It is expected that these consumers will find
the webpage after initially using search engines for results. On request of the owner en because of legal restrictions,
the information provided will be general: this is also what the consumer expects. It is also imaginable that potential employees will visit the website for some information.

## Features
### Existing Features
- Navigation bar.
-- The navigation bar indicates the active page (the active page is displayed in a white font color) and is translated for different language users. 
--The title in the left corner of the navigation bar also functions as a link to the default home page.
- Route button 
-- The route button in the address section allows users to plot a route via Google maps.
-Picture slider
--There are slides show of the interior
- Social links in the footer 
-- These links provide additional contact details if needed
- Houserules page
-- These pages display the house rules as they are stated on the physical location of the coffee shop. These pages are also accessible in English and french. 
-Vacancy page
--This page provides a section where interested employees can apply for a function as a bartender.

### Features Left to Implement
- A feature idea is a (Voorlichting / Information) section. This section will show information
about how to responsibly use the products sold at the coffee shop.

- Another feature idea is to expand the vacature (vacancy) page with an area the owner of the business can use to post vacancies when needed.
